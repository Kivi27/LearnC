From this date, the repository update will be very low or non-existent.<br>
I read the book "Programming: Introduction to the profession VOLUME 2" by A. Stolyarov and learned about the many possibilities of the C programming language and learned to use it to achieve its goal.<br>
<h2>How to compile?</h2>

<br>
g++ file.cpp -o file
